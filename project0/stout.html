                            <h1>Stouts</h1>
                            <p>While often associated with Ireland, stouts are said to have originally derived from porters in 
                                18th Century London. These days it has a wide range of sub-styles including Milk 
                                Stouts, Baltic Porters and Imperial Stouts.
                            </p>
                            <p>Originally, porters were made using large quantities of brown malt instead of the more
                                common pale malt. However, when this became too expensive recipes were adapted to use
                                mostly pale malt with some additonal black malt. Hop content tends to be fairly low, and stouts get 
                                a lot of their taste from the malt itself, and from the different ways in which the malt has been kilned. 
                                Below are a selection of my five favourite stouts from the UK. In general, I am a fan of a sweeter stout 
                                but I enjoy the huge variety currently available.

                            <p>With milk or sweet stout becoming the dominant stout in the UK in the early 20th century, it was mainly in Ireland that the non-sweet or standard stout was being made. As standard stout has a drier taste than the English and American sweet stouts, they came to be called dry stout or Irish stout to differentiate them from stouts with added lactose or oatmeal.[19][20][21] This is the style that represents a typical stout to most people.[22] The best selling stouts worldwide are Irish stouts made by Guinness (currently owned by Diageo) at St. James's Gate Brewery (also known as the Guinness Brewery) in Dublin. Guinness makes a number of different varieties of its Irish stouts.[23][24] Other examples </p>
