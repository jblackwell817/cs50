                        <p>While often associated with Ireland, stouts are said to have originally derived from porters in 
                            18th Century London. These days it has a wide range of sub-styles including (but far from limited
                            to) Milk Stouts, Oatmeal Stouts, Baltic Porters, Oyster Stouts and Imperial Stouts.
                        </p>
                        <p>Originally, porters were made using large quantities of brown malt instead of the more
                            common pale malt. However, when this became too expensive recipes were adapted to use
                            mostly pale malt with some additonal black malt. Hop content tends to be fairly low, and stouts get 
                            a lot of their taste from the malt itself, and from the different ways in which the malt has been kilned. 
                            In general, I am a fan of a sweeter stout but I enjoy the huge variety currently available.
